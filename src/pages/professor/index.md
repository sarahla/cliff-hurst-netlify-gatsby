I’ve been teaching one thing or another all of my life. Only in the past ten years, though, have I experienced the joy and intrinsic satisfaction that come from being a professor.

I﻿ am pleased to report that I have recently accepted an appointment as Assistant Professor of Entrepreneurship at Ohio Wesleyan University, beginning in August of 2023.

I currently teach as an adjunct faculty member at Fielding Graduate University. I teach in the Masters of Arts program in Organization Development and Leadership. Prior to that I was an assistant visiting professor at St. Edward's University and an associate professor at Westminster College in Salt Lake City, Utah. I've served as an adjunct professor at the University of San Francisco, UC Berkeley Extension, and Santa Clara University.

I’ve enjoyed teaching undergraduate as well as graduate students. I’ve taught a number of subjects, including entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, leadership, marketing, effective writing, public speaking, organizational behavior, and design thinking.

Professors often make a habit of putting into writing our teaching philosophy. [Here’s mine.](https://cliffordhurst.com/img/Hurst_teaching_philosophy.pdf)
