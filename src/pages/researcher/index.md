  S. Hartman \\[1910-1973]. Hartman developed a theory of the logic of human
  values known as formal axiology."

“Axiology” is used as a general term in philosophy to refer to the study of values. Hartman’s formal axiology is a particular approach to the study of values. It is considered “formal” because it is based upon deductive logic. In much the same way that Galileo began to unlock the mathematical logic that governs the functioning of the physical world, Hartman began to unlock the axio-logic that governs the functioning of our social, moral, and ethical world. He made an exciting discovery that deserves more research.

In 1976, the Robert S. Hartman Institute for Formal and Applied Axiology was founded as a non-profit organization in order to preserve, refine, advance, and make better known to the world the work begun by Hartman. Today, I serve on the board of directors of the Institute in the roles of Vice President of Research and as Editor of the *Journal of Formal Axiology: Theory and Practice*. You can learn more about the Institute and our work here: [www.hartmaninstitute.org.](http://www.hartmaninstitute.org/)

My personal journey into academic research was chronicled recently as a chapter in a monograph published by Fielding Graduate University (May, 2019). The book is entitled, *The Fielding Scholar Practitioner: Voices from 45 Years of Fielding Graduate University*. In the editors’ words, “This is a collection of essays, memoirs and research articles that capture the unique role of Fielding Graduate University as one of the nation’s oldest graduate institutions for mid-career learners.” I am proud to have earned my PhD at Fielding and to have contributed a chapter to this monograph.

My Fielding story, Chapter 2 in the book, is entitled, “On Becoming an Axiological Hermeneut.” You can read that submission [here](https://cliffordhurst.com/assets/pdfs/Hurst_On_becoming_an_axiological_hermeneut.pdf). This essay provides a chronological account of my published research since 2010.

Most of the articles described in that essay can be accessed [here](https://cliffordhurst.com/researcher/articles.html). They are also available on [www.academia.edu](https://westminstercollege.academia.edu/CliffordHurst) and [www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/).

I do not have permission to post publicly my 2019 article in *The International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior and Research*, which is entitled, “An Axiological Measure of Entrepreneurial Cognition.” It can be downloaded via an academic library search or purchased through Emerald Insight. Or, it can be [purchased from Emerald](https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/IJEBR-05-2018-0337). If you have trouble finding it, send me an email and I can get you a copy.

In my capacity as Vice President of Research for the Hartman Institute, I am leading a multi-year effort to select, edit, digitize, proofread, and publish more of Hartman’s previously unpublished works. Our first publication from this effort is entitled, *Five Lectures on Formal Axiology*, of which I am the Editor.

This is a slim volume that provides a good introduction to Hartman’s theory of formal axiology. This book, published in April of 2019, is now available both as a paperback and as an e-book from both [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Lectures-Formal-Axiology-Robert-Hartman/dp/1642280267/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Clifford+G.+Hurst&qid=1562162751&s=books&sr=1-1) and [Barnes & Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/five-lectures-on-formal-axiology-robert-s-hartman/1131056179?ean=9781642280265).

I am currently working to edit a volume of Hartman’s selected writing about war and peace. My goal is to have it published before the end of 2019. Three or four other planned volumes are in various stages of editing.

My next research project carries a working title of: “Change Over Time.” My aim is to investigate whether, and if so, in what ways, formal education results in long-term changes in college students’ deep-seated, often unconsciously held, thought patterns. Stay tuned. I will report on my findings here as they emerge.
