## Spoon carving? Go figure.

A few years ago, my wife, Dayna, said to me, *“Cliff you spend too much time in your head. All you ever talk about is your teaching and your research. You need a hobby.”*

She was right. But, what hobby should I take up? With her encouragement, I signed up for a 3-day spoon carving class that was taught concurrently with a course she was interested in at the John C. Campbell Folk School in North Carolina. I’ve been hooked since then.

Why am I drawn to carving wooden spoons? It’s a question I’ve asked myself more times than I’ve had answers for. First, I’ve always enjoyed woodworking. I built wooden boats in my twenties. There’s something about a fair curve of the lines of a well-built boat that has always drawn me.

But boats take a lot of time, money, and space to build. I needed a hobby where I could bring a piece of work from start to finish sooner than a boat. Spoons are fast. Boats can take years to build part-time. I can carve a spoon in a couple of days of after-hours leisure. I like that.

And, spoons are made—if they are made well—of fair curves. I take great joy in letting the grain of the wood dictate the shape that each spoon should take. Where the curves of a boat are built up from a combination of wood, fasteners, and glue, the curves of a spoon are simply revealed by carving away excess until only the spoon remains. They are simple. A single piece of wood. I like that.

I’m pleased to share here photos of some of the spoons I’ve carved, as well as some of my ramblings about the joy that spoon carving brings me.
